Video

`````html
<video controls width="640" height="480">
  <source src="videofile.mp4" type="video/mpeg">
  <source src="videofile.webm" type="video/webm">
  <!-- fallback for non supporting browsers goes here -->
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
`````

``<audio>`` and ``<video>`` have the same kind of structure. Dure to it's visual nature, there are a few extra things we can define for video. Here we define the width and height.

> *Note* that if we do not define a width or height, the browser will attempt to figure out the dimensions of the video file and use those.

The ``controls`` attribute specifies that we want our video to be displayed with play-back controls.
